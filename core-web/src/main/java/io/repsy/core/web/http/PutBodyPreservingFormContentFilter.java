/**
 * Spring Boot's {@link org.springframework.web.filter.FormContentFilter} that leaves the body of a
 * {@code PUT} or {@code PATCH} alone (RPS-1443).
 *
 * <p>The stock filter reads the body of a {@code PUT}, {@code PATCH} or {@code DELETE} into request
 * parameters whenever its {@code Content-Type} is {@code application/x-www-form-urlencoded}, and
 * that read consumes the stream. {@code curl -X PUT --data-binary @file} sends exactly that content
 * type unless told otherwise, so a Maven, Go, Cargo, Docker or Helm upload made that way used to
 * reach its handler as an empty body and was stored as a zero-byte file with a 200. On the wire
 * protocols a {@code PUT} or {@code PATCH} body is always the payload (an artifact, a blob chunk, a
 * manifest), whatever its content type says, and the panel API sends JSON, so neither needs the
 * parameters.
 *
 * <p>A {@code DELETE} still gets them: {@code gem yank} sends its gem name, version and platform as
 * a form-encoded body of a {@code DELETE}, and its handler reads them with {@code getParameter}.
 * Registering this filter makes Spring Boot's own one back off.
