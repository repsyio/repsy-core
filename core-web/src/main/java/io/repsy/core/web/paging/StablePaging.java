 * is the same on every request. A sort on a column that can hold equal values (a timestamp, a name,
 * a version) leaves the order of the tied rows to the database, which may return them differently
 * for two executions of the same query: a row then shows on two pages, or on none. Ending the sort
 * on the primary key breaks every tie.
