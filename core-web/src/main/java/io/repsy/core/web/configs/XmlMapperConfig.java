/**
 * The XML mapper.
 *
 * <p>{@link XmlMapper} extends the Jackson 3 {@code tools.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper}, which is
 * also the type Spring MVC and the protocol handlers inject. Spring Boot's own {@code JsonMapper}
 * is the {@code @Primary} one, so a plain {@code ObjectMapper} injection point still receives JSON
 * and XML is only ever injected by asking for {@link XmlMapper} explicitly (RPS-901, RPS-955). Do
 * not declare another {@code ObjectMapper} bean here: it would switch Boot's auto-configured JSON
 * mapper off.
 *
 * <p>The mapper is configured to write what the Jackson 2 one did: indented output, ISO-8601 dates,
 * numeric durations, properties in declaration order (Jackson 3 sorts them alphabetically), and a
 * plain empty element for null (Jackson 3 writes {@code xsi:nil}). Jackson 3 also ends indented
 * output with a newline.
